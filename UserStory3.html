<h2>Optimization Process</h2>

<p>
    The current goal of the MARVI Project is to determine the optimal number of wells within the network to be monitored. This step would be done by utilizing the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. The Ramer-Douglas–Peucker algorithm is an algorithm for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points. It does so by ‘thinking’ of a line between the first and last point in a set of points that form the curve. It checks which point in between is farthest away from this line. If the point (and as follows, all other in-between points) is closer than a given distance 'epsilon', it removes all these in-between points. This concept can be seen below:

    Therefore, in R, a line was constructed between all the points (i.e wells) in the well network. </p>

    The next step was to apply the algorithm to this connected scatterplot. The resulting optimized network can be seen below:</p>

    Finally, it was necessary to test the watershed using kriging interpolation with the new well network.

    When comparing a heatmap of the region between the entire network and the optimized network, the results are analogous. This comparison can be seen below:
