<h2>Optimization Process</h2>

<p>
    The current goal of the MARVI Project is to determine the optimal number of wells within the network to be monitored. This step would be done by utilizing the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. The Ramer-Douglas–Peucker algorithm is an algorithm for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points. It does so by ‘thinking’ of a line between the first and last point in a set of points that form the curve. It checks which point in between is farthest away from this line. If the point (and as follows, all other in-between points) is closer than a given distance 'epsilon', it removes all these in-between points. This concept can be seen below:

    Therefore, in R, a line was constructed between all the points (i.e wells) in the well network.

    The next step was to apply the algorithm to this connected scatterplot. The resulting optimized network can be seen below:

    Finally, it was necessary to test the watershed using kriging interpolation with the new well network.

    When comparing a heatmap of the region between the entire network and the optimized network, the results are analogous. This comparison can be seen below:
