<h1>MARVI Project</h1>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    The Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention (MARVI) project is a trans-disciplinary research and development project spanning from 2012 to present. “The overall aim of MARVI is to improve the security of irrigation water supplies and enhance livelihood opportunities for rural communities in India. Specifically, MARVI's focus is to develop an effective participatory groundwater monitoring program at village level, assess the effectiveness of current rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge structures and develop demand management strategies that will make the groundwater use sustainable.” Focusing on hard rock water tables found in both the Dharta watershed and the Meghraj watershed in the Udaipur district in Rajasthan and the Aravalli district in Gujarat respectively, the MARVI project utilizes Bhujal Jaankaar (BJ), a Hindi word for “Groundwater Informed”, to monitor and educate villagers to groundwater usage across participating communities. Most of the water for irrigation for crop production as well as drinking water is sourced from groundwater. Because it rarely rains in India outside of the 3 month monsoon season, water conservation is critical. The ultimate goal of the project is then to inform local populations in hopes of educating and promoting more sustainable water usage and farming methods.

    “The MARVI project is funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). Key partners of this project are Western Sydney University, CSIRO Land & Water, International Water Management Institute, Development Support Centre, Arid Communities and Technologies, Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology and Vidya Bhawan Krishi Vigyan Kendra.”2 Dr. Basant Maheshwari of Western Sydney University is the lead on this project and project liaison.

<h2>Project Scope</h2>

<p>The purpose of the project is to develop an effective participatory groundwater monitoring program at village level, assess the effectiveness of current rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge structures and develop demand management strategies that will make the groundwater use sustainable. This dashboard will hopefully answer questions in hopes of furthering understanding of sustainable practices in Rajasthan and Gujarat and allowing villagers to make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>About the Data</h2>

<p>The data comes primarily from the hard work of the Bhujal Jaankaar (BJ) across 5 villages of Rajasthan and Gujarat.The dataset used contains information from approximately 50 wells in each of the 5 villages, or approximately 250 wells. This dataset was already cleaned, prepared and contained time-series data related to groundwater levels, well depth and locational coordinates.</p>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>

<ul>
 <p>This visualization is meant to capture groundwater levels of all wells monitored by the MARVI Project from August 2012 to December 2019.

<p>This visualization is meant to show the comparison of watershed interpolation through the kriging process. The water levels are broken by season and then compared year over year.

<p>
    This visualization is meant to display the process involved in creating an optimized well network. By reducing the number of wells to around 25, we hope to lessen the burden on the Bhujal Jaankaar (BJ) while maintaining accuracy in water and well behavior.

<p>
    This visualization is meant to show the final results of the optimization process and the 25 wells to monitor moving forward.
