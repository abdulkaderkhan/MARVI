<h2>Watershed Interpolation Through Kriging Process</h2>

<p>
    The start of each season was kriged from 2012 to 2018 and then compared. 2019 was excluded as there were significantly more data entries missing during this year. 
</p>

<p>
    The first season kriged was Winter, which starts in December and ends in February. Looking at the data, it is clear that 2016 has significantly higher groundwater levels as well as subsequent years when compared to pre-2016 levels.

    The next season kriged was summer or pre-monsoon season, which begins in March and ends around May. From looking at our kriged data, it is noticeably apparent that more groundwater is available almost every subsequent year.

<p>
    Monsoon season, again, typically starts in June and ends in September. It is expected that there isn’t a large increase in groundwater level at this point as the rainy season is just beginning.

<p>
    Lastly, the post monsoon season, which is also the fall season, begins lasting from October to November. This is where the increase in groundwater level from the rainy season will be available. This clearly shows how much greater the rainfall was in 2016. However, it is unclear if the results in 2018 were due to missing data or due to extraneous environmental issues.
